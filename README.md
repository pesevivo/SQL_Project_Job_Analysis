# Background
Motivated by the desire to better understand the data analyst job market, this project was initiated to identify highly paid and sought-after skills, thereby facilitating others in finding the best job opportunities.

The data used comes from Luke Barousse's website: https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql

It is real-world data for the year 2023 and contains job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills related to different data positions.

### The questions answered through queries:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for the top-paying jobs?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for data analysts?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Tools Used
- **SQL**: Fundamental to the analysis, enabling the querying of the database and the discovery of essential insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The selected RDBMS.
- **Visual Studio Code**: I used the IDE as a tool for editing the database and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Crucial for version control and distributing my SQL scripts and analysis, facilitating collaboration and monitoring of the project.
# The Analysis
Each of the 5 questions explores an aspect of the data analysis job market in the USA.

### 1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
I joined the main fact table with the dimensional table containing information about the companies (in order to investigate at which companies are those top-paying jobs). Then, I set the filters to include only data analyst jobs in the USA with disclosed salary (non-null values). Finally order the jobs by salary and limit to top 10. 

```sql
 SELECT
    jp_fact.job_id,
    jp_fact.job_title,
    cp_dim.name AS company_name,
    jp_fact.job_schedule_type,
    jp_fact.salary_year_avg,
    jp_fact.job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS jp_fact 
    INNER JOIN company_dim AS cp_dim ON jp_fact.company_id = cp_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_country = 'United States'
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT
    10
```

### 2. What skills are required for the top-paying jobs?
First, I wrapped the top-paying jobs query in a CTE (Common Table Expression). Then, I joined the table with the two dimensions related to skills.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        jp_fact.job_id,
        jp_fact.job_title,
        cp_dim.name AS company_name,
        jp_fact.salary_year_avg
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact AS jp_fact
        INNER JOIN company_dim AS cp_dim ON jp_fact.company_id = cp_dim.company_id
    WHERE 
        job_country = 'United States'
        AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 
        10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    sk_dim.skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS skjob_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skjob_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sk_dim ON skjob_dim.skill_id = sk_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC  
```
#### Insights:
Most high-paying jobs require proficiency in several data analytics tools and programming languages. Commonly listed skills include:

- **Programming languages** like Python, R, and SQL are frequently mentioned, highlighting their importance in data manipulation and analysis.

### 3. What are the most in-demand skills for data analysts?
Here I joined the fact table with the dimensions containing skills data. Filters are set to reflect only USA jobs pertaining to data analyst positions. Then, I aggregated on the skills and ended up with a count for each skill. The key part here is that I take into consideration all jobs and not only the top-paying ones, like in queries 1 and 2. In the end we limit the selection to 5.

```sql
SELECT
    sk_dim.skill_id,
    sk_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skjob_dim.job_id) AS skill_demand
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS jp_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS skjob_dim ON jp_fact.job_id = skjob_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sk_dim ON skjob_dim.skill_id = sk_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    jp_fact.job_country = 'United States'
    AND jp_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
    sk_dim.skill_id,
    sk_dim.skills
ORDER BY
    skill_demand DESC
LIMIT 5
```

#### Insights:
- **The most common skills encompass a well-established suite of technologies which covers the data analysis process from start to finish:** SQL for data retrieval/processing, Python and Excel primarily for data processing and Power BI, Tableau primarily for data visualization.

### 4. What are the top skills based on salary?
I joined the fact table with the dimensions containing skills data. After inputting the necessary filter, the data is aggregated by the skills field. Finally, I displayed the average salary for each skill. I limit the selection to top 10 skills based on salary.

```sql
SELECT
    sk_dim.skill_id,
    sk_dim.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(jp_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) as avg_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS jp_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS skjob_dim ON jp_fact.job_id = skjob_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sk_dim ON skjob_dim.skill_id = sk_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    jp_fact.job_country = 'United States'
    AND jp_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND jp_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    sk_dim.skill_id,
    sk_dim.skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### 5. What are the most optimal skills to learn? (high demand and high paying)
In this query I am essentially matching average salary per skill data with skill demand data. The key part is I am looking at skills with a demand higher or equal to 5. Only roles with disclosed salaries are taken into account. In the ordering, priority is given to the skill demand.

```sql
SELECT 
    sk_dim.skill_id,
    sk_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skjob_dim.job_id) AS skill_demand,
    ROUND(AVG(jp_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) as avg_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS jp_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS skjob_dim ON jp_fact.job_id = skjob_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sk_dim ON skjob_dim.skill_id = sk_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    jp_fact.job_country = 'United States'
    AND jp_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND jp_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    sk_dim.skill_id,
    sk_dim.skills
HAVING
   COUNT(skjob_dim.job_id) >= 500
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    skill_demand DESC
LIMIT
    10
```
#### Insights:
